# Geometric_shape_classification
- In this project a CNN model is designed using Pytorch.
- The Neural Network will decide which one of the 9 classes: Circle, Square, Octagon, Heptagon, Nonagon, Star, Hexagon, Pentagon, Triangle does the input image belong to.
- The dataset contains 90,000 images, where each image has size 200x200.
- There are 10,000 images per class.

# Steps for running the code
- Save all the files and the dataset in the same directory.

- Execute the Model.py file, it will save the model.
- Execute the Prediction.py file, it will use the saved model to make predictions on different dataset, that dataset should be in the same directory too.
